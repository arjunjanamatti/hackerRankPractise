######## Problem
# Given the positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be
# calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the minimum
# and maximum values as a single line of two space seperated long integers.
# For example arr = [1,3,5,7,9], minimum sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
# and maximum sum is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24
#

# Time complexity
# O(1): order of 1 or constant time, like 2 + 3
# O(log n): means splitting the inputs each step, like deviding it by 2
# O(n): is order over n, like single for loop
# O(n^2): order to power n**2, double for loop over "n" size
