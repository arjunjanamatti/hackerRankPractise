############ Problem
# Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two
# challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories:
# problem clarity, originality and difficulty.
# We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet
# a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]) and rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet
# b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).
# Compare a[0] with b[0], and continuing for all 3.
#   - If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point
#   - If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point
#   - If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point
